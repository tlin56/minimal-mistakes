Jason Lin's Personal website
====

Hey y'all! I'm Jason Lin, a creative soul living & studying in Los Angeles, CA. Currently I'm a doctoral candidate in the Department of Biomathematics under the University of California, Los Angeles.

My current academic advisor is Van Savage.

My research interests are System Biology, Interaction Networks, Decision Making, Evolution, information dynamics in biology & signalling.

Currently, I am working with Van Savage on a summer rotation project. The project embarks on exploring the idea that the trophic interaction dimensionality can be one of the significant stressors for the bimodality in size-ratio distributions of ecological communities.
